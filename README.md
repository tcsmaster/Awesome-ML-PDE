# Machine Learning for PDEs Solvers

Recently, there are a growing number of papers trying to solve PDEs with Machine Learning. This respository is trying to collect papers, blogs, videos, and any format materials in this field. I believe this filed will have a huge impact on science and engineering, although it still has some unsolved problems.

Note that I think researchers in different universities or companies use differnt methods, so I sort all resources with their affiliation.
